This project serves to demonstrate how typescript and object-oriented programming can be used to execute code in ways that JavaScript cannot. 
A successful execution of this project will present the user with two initial choices: either build a vehicle or choose from an exisiting one. Upon that selection, the user will be presented with a series of additional actions that they can click through. After cycling through those options, they can then exit the program.
The largest challenge faced in this project was learning how to organize the code and correctly import the information from the 'classes' and 'interfaces' pages into the Cli.ts to produce the required options and actions. 
In this process, I learned the importance of reviewing each of the pages within a project first before jumping in to begin coding. I worked with a tutor who helped me prioritize the tasks and then begin working in a more orderly manner.
